                                    Working with your educational technology provider can be crucial for getting the information you need for a successful evaluation. Providers can be useful at multiple stages throughout the process, from helping you understand best practices for implementation to getting you the usage data you need to understand who is using your technology and how. This tool will help you start a productive conversation with your provider.

The purpose of this call is to <span class="insert-text">[discuss how we can obtain usage data needed for the evaluation]</span>.
