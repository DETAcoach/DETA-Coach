                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Schools, district administrators, and teachers are constantly making decisions that have the potential to affect students’ outcomes. The purchase and use of educational technologies, or “ed tech,” are one area in which educators regularly make and revisit decisions. Currently, objective scientific evidence does not play an important role in this decision making process. Instead, experience, subjective recommendations, and sometimes, marketing materials are the only information sources available to support these choices.</p>
                <p>The Ed Tech RCE Coach is designed to provide districts with an online &ldquo;toolkit&rdquo; of resources containing everything needed to plan and execute a Rapid Cycle Evaluation of an educational technology. The Coach includes all the tools needed to conduct forward-looking pilot of a new technology or a backwards-looking evaluation of a technology that has already been implemented with a subset of schools, teachers, or students.  </p>
                <p>The Coach was funded by the Office of Educational Technology at the U.S. Department of Education under contract number ED-OOS-15-C-0053. Mathematica Policy Research led the development of the Coach in partnership with SRI, International, Concentric Research and Evaluation, and Cooper. </p>
                <p>The development of the Coach benefitted from input from school district partners and a Technical Working Group. We will continue to improve the Coach over time and invite you to submit comments or suggestions at any time. </p>
                <p>
