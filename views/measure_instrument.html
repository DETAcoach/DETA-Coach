                                    How you measure your outcome can be as important as the outcome itself. This tool will help you identify an appropriate instrument for your evaluation. It provides a list of instruments that target a variety of non-student academic achievement outcomes and links to other resources that can help you find an instrument. Our guide, <a target="_blank" href="/static/pdf/RCE_Guide_Choosing_Outcome_Measure.pdf">How to choose an outcome and measure</a>, can help you think through these concepts in more detail and apply them to your potential instruments.

For example, you can measure student academic achievement through scores on standardized tests or through performance on teacher or district developed assessments. You can measure student engagement through attendance records or through a student survey.</p>
                                <p>However, you may not be able to directly measure your outcome. You may need to analyze your technology&rsquo;s effect on another, related outcome instead.
